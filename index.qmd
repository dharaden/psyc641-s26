## Class Structure

This course will be accelerated, but will also be self-paced (i.e., asynchronous). There will be set deadlines for various projects/assignments, but you are free to structure your time otherwise. There will be 6 total units that cover a brief introduction into various areas of psychology. Each topic will typically consist of:

-   Brief Lectures
-   Readings
-   Assignment
-   Content Quiz

There will not be a final exam, but there will be a final project that will be due at the end of the semester.
